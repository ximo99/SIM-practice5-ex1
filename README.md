# Simulation. Practice 5, exercise 1: sea waves.
Simulation subject within the Multimedia Engineering degree from the ETSE - Universitat de València. April 2022. Practice 5, exercise 1. Rating 9. It is requested to achieve realistic simulation of different waves based on height maps. In the first exercise, the user will be able to generate different types of waves with the help of the keyboard and combine them.

# Project setup
The user can interact with the system and perform the following actions. To do this, in the first exercise, you must press different keys:
  - S key, adds a sine wave to the system.
  - R key, adds a radial wave to the system.
  - R key, adds a Gerstner wave to the system.
  - C key, change the display mode (mesh or texture that simulates water).
  - I key, restart the simulation.
  - Key 1, decreases the amplitude of the next wave added to the system.
  - Key 2, increases the amplitude of the next wave added to the system.
  - Key 3, decreases the wavelength of the next wave added to the system.
  - Key 4, increases the wavelength of the next wave added to the system.
  - Key 5, decreases the speed of the next wave added to the system.
  - Key 6, increases the speed of the next wave added to the system.
